#+TITLE: MongoDB - The Complete Developer's Guide, Udemy - Notes

* 2. What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is database
The enteprise backing MongoDB is also called MongoDB

The name is stemming from the word humongous
-> Meant to store a lot of data

MongoDB's server provides multiple databases
Collections are stored inside a database
Documents are store inside collections

Inside a collection, you are schemaless

You can structure your data in MongoDB though

Documents are stored in the JSON format
A JSON document is delimited by `{}`

A key is composed of a name and a value separated by a colon
The name must be surrounded by `""`
Keys names are often referred to as simply keys
Values can be strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and even nested data (i.e., embedded documents)
-> Enables you to create complex data and store it in a single document (which is more efficient that resolving relation in a RDB)

Behind the scenes, MongoDB converts the JSON into a binary format called BSON (more efficient to query and store)

MongoDB is flexible and usable
