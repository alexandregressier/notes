* 2. What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is database
The enteprise backing MongoDB is also called MongoDB

The name is stemming from the word humongous
-> Meant to store a lot of data

MongoDB's server provides multiple databases
Collections are stored inside a database
Documents are store inside collections

Inside a collection, you are schemaless

You can structure your data in MongoDB though

Documents are stored in the JSON format
A JSON document is delimited by `{}`

A key is composed of a name and a value separated by a colon
The name must be surrounded by `""`
Keys names are often referred to as simply keys
Values can be strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and even nested data (i.e., embedded documents)
-> Enables you to create complex data and store it in a single document (which is more efficient that resolving relation in a RDB)

Behind the scenes, MongoDB converts the JSON into a binary format called BSON (more efficient to query and store)

MongoDB is flexible, performant, and usable


* 4. The Key MongoDB Characteristics (and how they differ from SQL Databases)

Schemaless can lead to messy data b/c it your responsability to work with clean data

You also work with less relations in MongoDB b/c you store data together

It does not need to merge data most of the time
-> Improves performance


* 5. Understanding the MongoDB Ecosystem

The MongoDB enterprise provides:
- The MongoDB database
  - Self-managed / Enterprise
  - Tools: CloudManager / OpsManager
- Atlas: MongoDB on the Cloud
- Mobile
- GUI: compass
- Business Intelligence connectors
- MongoDB Charts

New offering: Stitch (serverless backend solution)
-> A bit unrelated to the MongoDB database
- Serverless Query API
- Serverless functions
- Database triggers
- Real-Time sync
