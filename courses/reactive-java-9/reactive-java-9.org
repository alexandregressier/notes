* What is reactive programming ?

#+begin_quote
Reactive programming is a programming paradigm oriented around *data flows* and the *propagation of change*.
#+end_quote

Data stream/flow: a sequence of ongoing events ordered in time

W/ reactive programming, `a = b + c`, if the b or c changes, a will change as well

Imperative/OO can work w/ reactive programming

/Propagation of change/

https://reactivex.io

Many implementations: Rx.NET, RxJava, RxScala, RxCpp

Reactive extension: a set of APIs that brings the reactive programming paradigm


** Benefits

- More flexible
- Scalable & resilient
- Efficient use of resources
- Less latency
- More tolerance of failure
- Highly responsive

By essence, reactive is fundamentally asynchronous & non-blocking
-> Plays well w/ functionnal programming

Push VS Pull mechanism
- Imperative: we pull & process things synchronously using iterators
- Reactive: you take the pull model & convert it to a push model

  
** Reactive explained in a simple way

Data flows & propagation of change

A stream can be seen as pipe in which data flows
-> Data moves in a certain direction
-> The data has a type
-> Errors & Completion signals (closes the stream) can flow as well

The /source/ of information is the entity which emits data
The /consumer/ is the entity which listends to the streams to receive data

IMPORTANT: consumers do not pull the data, the data is pushed to them
-> The consumer does not know when the data is going to come

A consumer can start receiving data from a source of information by subscribing to the data flow
The consumer wil receive the items that the source of information emits

The subscription will have to deal w/ backpressure so that the source cannot overflow the consumer

Cold VS Hot sources of information:
- Cold: start running upon subscription
  - Creates the source of information
  - Activates the source of information
  - Consumer starts listening to the source
  - Unicast (only the consumer listen to information)
- Hot: always emitting data, even before a subscription is active
  - Consumer shares a reference to a source of information
  - Consumer starts listening to the producer
  - Multicast (usually, but they could be a listening to a producer that only supports one listener at a time)


Principles of reactive programming:
- Responsive
  - Responds in a timely manner if possible
  - Key to usability & utility
  - Consistent response times

- Resilient
  - The system stays responsive when facing failure
  - Performance, endurance, and security
  - Ensuring that components are dependent enough so failure does not compromise the whole system

- Elastic/Scalable
  - The system stauys responsive under varying workload
  - Designs w/ no contention points or bottlenecks
  - Ability to share or replicate components & distribute inputs among them
  - Scaling up or out (elasticity)

- Message driven
  - Reactive apps rely on async message passing to establish a boundary between components
  - Ensure loose coupling, isolation & location transparency
  - Delegate failure as messages
  - Non-blocking communication allows recipient to only consume resources while active
  - A message driven app may be event-driven, actor based, or a combination of the two
    - An event-driven system is based on events which are monitored by 0+ observers
    - Actor based concurrency is an extension of the message passing architecture where messages are sent to recipients
      called actors
    - Difference: messages are directed to defined destinations while events just happen

-> See the reactive manifesto: https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/

Reactive programming is not meant to deal well w/ thread-based frameworks


Backpressure:
- Is related to resilience
- Ensure that all participate in flow control
- A fast source of information should not overwhelm a slow consumer
- The push model works well when consumers are faster than producers (hard to predict though)

Unfortunately, most stream processing systems forces us to choose between push & pull at development time
- Solution 1: choose pull model, to protect us from overwhelming our slower consumer (+ loss of system resources when consumer are
  faster than producers)
- Solution 2: increase the buffer size of push models (possible but often unrealistic b/c of memory consumption)
- Solution 3: drop elements, but not always appropriate
-> We need a bidirectional flow of data
  - Elements emitting downstream from producer to consumer & a signal for demaning emitted upstream from consumer to producer

Providing backpressure all the way through the entire flow gives the system a chance to respond to excessive flow
Backpressure is when the progress of turning the input to output by a program is resisted in some way


Ways that Java supports reactive programming (not native):
- Reactive streams: a set of low level interfaces
- RxJava: developped by Netflix, using reactive patterns internally
- Reactor: Pivotal, builds on reactive stream
- Spring framework 5.0
- Ratpack: a set of libraries
- Akka: actor pattern

  
** Reactive streams

Reactive streams debuted in 2013 as an initiative between engineers at Netflix, Pivotal, & Typesafe (now Lightbend)

A standard for async stream processing w/ non-blocking backpressure

Emcompasses efforts aimed at runtime environments (JVM & JS) as well as network protocols

Solved problems:
- Handling streams of data requires special care in an async system
- Resource consumption needs to be controlled such that a fast data source does not overwhelm the stream destination
  (backpressure)
- Many conforming implementations for different languages that can interoperate smoothly

Scope:
- Find a minimal set of interfaces/methods/protocols that will describe the necessary operations and entities to achieve the goal
- End-user DSLs or protocol binding APIs have purposefully been left out of the scope to encourage different implementations
- Define a model for backpressure, a way to ensure a fast publisher does not overwhelm a slow subscriber

Working groups:
- Basic semantics: define how the transmission of data is regulated through backpressure
  - How elements are represented, their representations during transfer, or how backpressure is signaled is not part of
    this spec
- JVM interfaces
- JS interfaces
- Network protocols: TCP, UDP, WebSockets

Reactive JVM - Reactive elements
- Source of information: `Publisher<T>`
- Consumer: `Subscriber<T>`
- Subscription: `Subscription`
- Combination of source of information & consumer: `Processor<T, R>`
  - Has the ability to receive data & sending it

#+BEGIN_SRC java
  public interface Processor<T, R> extends Subscriber<T>, Publisher<T> {}

  public interface Publisher<T> {
      public void subscribe(Subsriber<? super T> s); // Methods called by the subscriber
  }

  public interface Subscriber<T> {
      public void onSubscribe(Subscription s); // Methods called by the publisher
      public void onNext(T t);
      public void onError(Throwable t);
      public void onComplete();
  }

  public interface Subscription {
      public void request(long n); // `n` is the amount requested
      public void cancel();
  }
#+END_SRC


Rules:
- If a publisher fails, it must signal an onError
- If a publisher terminates successfully (finite stream), it must signal an onComplete
- If a subscription is cancelled, its subscriber must eventually stop being signaled
- `Publisher.subscribe()` may be called as many times as wanted but must be w/ a different subscriber each time
  - The same object can subscribe twice to a publisher
- A subscriber must signal demand via `Subscription.request(long n)` to receive `onNext` signals


* Reactivity in Java 9

Supports via the Reactive API (a.k.a. Flow API)


** Java 9 features

- Private interface methods
  - Reusing code between default methods had to be public in Java 8

#+BEGIN_SRC java
  public interface InJava8 {

      default float multiply(int x, in y) {
          if (inputZero(x) || inputZero(y)) return 0;
          return x * y;
      }

      default float divide(int x, int y) throws Exception {
          if (inputZero(y)) throw new Exception("Error");
          return x / y;
      }

      // We do not want this to be public
      default boolean inputZero(int x) {
          return x == 0;
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC java
  public interface InJava9 {

      default float multiply(int x, in y) {
          if (inputZero(x) || inputZero(y)) return 0;
          return x * y;
      }

      default float divide(int x, int y) throws Exception {
          if (inputZero(y)) throw new Exception("Error");
          return x / y;
      }

      // Possible in Java 9
      private boolean inputZero(int x) {
          return x == 0;
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

- Collection factory methods
  - Java 9 provides static factory methods on the collection interfaces
  - Java 9 supports immutable collections

#+BEGIN_SRC java
  List.of("one").add("two"); // Error: the first List expression is immutable

  List<String> list = List.of("one", "two", "three");

  Map<String, Integer> mapImmediate = Map.of("one", 1,
                                             "two", 2,
                                             "three", 3);

  Map<String, Integer> mapEntries = Map.ofEntries(entry("one", 1),
                                                  entry("two", 2),
                                                  entry("three", 3));

#+END_SRC

- Process API: improve the API for controlling and managing OS processes

Example: getting the current process PID
In Java 8:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
  Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[] {
          "/bin/sh",
          "-c",
          "echo $PPID",
      });

  if (proc.waitFor() == 0) {
      InputStream in = proc.getInputStream();
      int available = in.available();

      byte[] outputBytes = new byte[available];
      in.read(outputBytes);

      String pid = new String(outputBytes);
      System.out.println("PID: " + pid);
  }
#+END_SRC

In Java 9:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
  System.out.println("PID: " + ProcessHandle.current().getPid());
#+END_SRC

- Stack walking: define an efficient standard API for stack walking that allows easy filtering of, and lazy access to,
  the information in stack traces

#+BEGIN_SRC java
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
      walkFilterAndGetTenStackFrame().forEach(System.out::println);
  }

  private static List<String> walkFilterAndGetTenStackFrame() {
      return StackWalker.getInstance().walk(s ->
                                            s.map(frame -> frame.getClassName() + "/" + frame.getMethodName())
                                            .filter(name -> name.startsWith("package.name"))
                                            .limit(10)
                                            .collect(Collectors.toList()));
  }
#+END_SRC

- HTTP client API that implements HTTP/2 and WebSocket
  - Will replace the old HTTP URL connection API (which is as old as HTTP/1.1)

Synchronous:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
  HttpResponse httpResponse = HttpRequest.create(new URI("http://127.0.0.1:8080"))
      .GET()
      .response();

  int statusCode = httpResponse.statusCode();
  String body = httpResponse.body(HttpResponse.asString());
#+END_SRC

Asynchronous:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
  HttpRequest.create(new URI("http://127.0.0.1:8080"))
      .GET()
      .responseAsync()
      .thenAccept(httpResponse -> {
              int statusCode = httpResponse.statusCode();
              String body = httpResponse.body(HttpResponse.asString());
          });
#+END_SRC

- Project Jigsaw: modular JDK source code
  - Make Java development easier on e.g., IoT devices
- Lightweight JSON API: generate JSON documents & data streams (purpose: being native & provide interoperability)
- Multi-resolution images
- Platform logging API & service
- HTML 5 Javadoc (+ satisfies accessibility requirements)
- Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) (e.g., UDP is a datagram protocol)

  
Removed APIs:
- The applet API
- Corba
- Explicit constructors for primitive wrappers (e.g., `new Integer(5)`)
