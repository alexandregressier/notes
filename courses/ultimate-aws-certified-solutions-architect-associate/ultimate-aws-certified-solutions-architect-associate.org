Ensure to validate your account via the activation email

The validation process can take up to 24 hours
-> But usually take a few minutes

#+begin_quote
AWS cancels the authorization request as soon as it's approved by your financial institution

* 3 - AWS Fundamentals: IAM & EC2

** AWS Fundamentals - Section introduction

IAM: Amazon Identity and Access Management
-> Creating users, groups, & policies

EC2: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud


** AWS Regions & AZs

AWS has regions all around the world:
- E.g., us-east-1, ap-southeast-2

Each region has availability zones (AZ):
- Ends up w/ a letter (goes up to `f` so far)
- E.g., us-east-1a, us-east-1b
- Each AZ maps to a physical data center in the region
  - Isolated from each others in case of disasters

Each AWS console is *region scoped*
- Except IAM & S3
- AZs are not shown in the console

Choosing a region:
- Choose the closest to you
- Choose one w/ at least 3 AZs

See a map of the regions:
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/


** IAM introduction
   
The whole AWS security resides in IAM
IAM is at the center of AWS (i.e., every console relates to it)

Managing:
- Users:
  - Are usually attributed to physical persons
- Groups: gather users
  - By function (e.g., admins, devops)
  - By team (e.g., engineering, design)
  - Permission tree
- Roles: internal usage w/in AWS resources
  - Are attributed to machines

The 3 interacts w/ /policies/:
- JSON documents
- Defines what each one can & cannot do

IMPORTANT: the *root account* should never be used & shared
- Use it only the very first time

Create users w/ proper permissions

IAM has a global view (i.e., region agnostic)

Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) can be setup

IAM has predefined /managed policies/

/Least privilege principle/
-> Attribute the minimal amount of permission required

IAM Federation:
- Meant for large enterprises owning an Active Directory (AD)
- Enables users to connect via LDAP
- Uses the /Security Assertion Markup Language/ (SAML) standard

Rules:
- 1 IAM user per physical person
- 1 IAM role per application
- Never share & write IAM credentials (especially in code)
- Never use the root account (except for initial setup)


** IAM hands on

The `Security Status` states what needs to be done in order to protect your AWS account:
- Delete your root access keys (root only)
- Activate MFA on your root account
- Create individual IAM users
- Use groups to assign permissions
- Apply an IAM password policy
- Rotate your access keys (Non-root only)

MFA:
- MFA setup is optional
- FreeOTP is FOSS Android application that works as well
- Enter the 1st code
- Wait 30 seconds
- Enter the 2nd code

Creating a super user (just under root):
- Add user
- Choose a user name
- Grant the `Programmatic` & `AWS Management Console` accesses
- Leave the `Autogenerated password` & `Require password reset`
- Next: Groups
- `Attach existing policies directly`
  - Select `AdministratorAccess`
- Set permissions boundary > Create user without a permissions boundary
- Create user

2 policies (permissions) attached:
- AdministratorAccess
- IAMUserChangePassword: forces the user to change its password

-> DO NOT FORGET to download the credentials as .csv (to have your password)

Creating a new group:
- Create new group
- Group Name: admin
- Attach Policy: AdministratorAccess

A group has its own set of permissions

Note that the permissions of the group are redundant w/ the user created previously:
- Detach the `AdministratorAccess` permission from the user

Manage group:
- Click on the group name from the list
- Define the permissions
- Create
- Add users

A password policy:
- Ensure that the password used are strong
- Are changed often enough

Creating a password policy:
- Set password policy button
- Enforce minimum password length: 8 characters
- Enable password expiration: 90 days
- Prevent password reuse: Remember 5 password(s) 
- Opinion: Tick all options except `Password expiration requires administrator reset`

You can create aliases for accounts

** EC2 introduction

EC2: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
- The basis of AWS
- Were the way AWS worked for a long time
- One of the most popular service

Features:
- Renting virtual machines (EC2)
- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS: Elastic Block Store)
- Distributing load across machienes (ELB: Elastic Load Balancing)
- Scaling services using an ASG (Auto Scaling Groups)

Different from serverless technologies

Create a new EC2 instance:
-> Do not refresh the form!

- Make sure you are in the right region
- Launch Instance > Launch Instance button

- Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI): the OS that will be launched on that server
  - Notice the `Free tier eligible` AMIs
  - Choose an Amazon Linux (version 2) AMI to benefit from Amazon-specific stuff
  -> This is how Amazon sees you using Linux

- Choose an instance type (i.e., how powerful you want your machine to be)
  - t2.micro is free tier eligible
  - ATM max is 96 vCPUs & 768 GiBs memory

- Next: Configure Instance Details
  - You can launch several instances at a time
  - On-demand instances VS Spot instances
  - Choose the VPC & subnet (default subnet in AZ, which can be other than `a`)
  - Auto-assign Public IP: Use subnet setting (Enable)

Note: Every AWS account comes w/ a default VPC & 3 subnets (1 per AZ)

- Next: Add Storage
  - Block device name: `/dev/xvda`
  - Size: 8 GiB
  - Volume Type: General Purpose SSD (gp2)
  - Important: you can choose to not delete storage on EC2 termination

- Next: Add Tags
  - /Tags/ are key-value pairs
  - Enables you to identify that instance & classify it
  - Tags can also be defined to whatever you want
  - "Name": "My first instance"

- Next: Configure Security Group (SG)
  - Act as a firewall around your instance (i.e., controls inbound & outbound traffic)
  - Assign a security group: Create a new security group
  - Name: my-first-sg
  - Description: Created with my first EC2 instance
  - Source: My IP (0.0.0.0/0 - Opened to the world is not a best practice)
  - Has an SSH rule (port 22) by default

- Review Instance Launch
  - `Launch` button
  - Define what key pair will be used to access the instance
    - If you do not have one: Create a new key pair
    - Choose a name
    - `Download Key Pair` button (.pem file)
    - Key pairs can be accessed in EC2 > Network & Security > Key Pairs
  - `Launch instances` button

The instance has been named acccording to the "Name" tag
Instance State: `(Green) running` means that you can be billed

Right click on a instance record > Instance State to change the state of the instance
- Terminate: delete the instance & lose access to it


** SSH overview

SSH: Secure Shell

Amazon EC2 Instance Connect
- A simple & secure way to connect to your instances using SSH
- Works the browser

SSH is usually what people have the most problems w/ during their learning of AWS


** How to SSH using Linux or Mac

The EC2 instance has a public IP
Its SG allows SSH access (via port 22)

EC2's description:
- Public DNS (IPv4)
- IPv4 Public IP
- Security Groups: you can click on:
  - View inbound rules: 22 tcp
  - View outbout rules: All All 0.0.0.0/0

`ec2-user` is always the Linux user on the Amazon Linux machine

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ ssh ec2-user@ec2-35-180-68-162.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com
  # OR
  $ ssh ec2-user@35.180.68.162
  # OR (w/ public key)
  $ ssh -i 'key.pem' ec2-user@ec2-35-180-68-162.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com
#+END_SRC

Make sure to add the host to the list of known hosts on first connection

The `key.pem` file mode must be 0400 (read only-for myself) (0644 by default)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ chmod 0400 key.pem
#+END_SRC

The EC2 instance should have internet access

<C-d> to go back to the shell's client

Use PuTTY under Windows < 10:
- Convert the `key.pem` file via PuTTYgen to .ppk:
  - File > Load private key
  - Save the generated key: Save private key button
  - You can set a passphrase if desired
- Open PuTTY:
  - Connection > SSH > Auth
  - Private key file for authentication: Browse...
  - Go back to Session
  - Connect w/ user `ec2-user` & host given for the EC2 instance
  - Save the session if desired
  - Open

Under Windows >= 10, you probably have an SSH client available (and use the same commands as under Linux)
- Having the right permissions on the key.pem file:
  - Properties > Security tab > Advanced...
  - Make sure you are the owner of the file
  - Disable inheritance
  - Convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions on this object
  - Remove SYSTEM & Administrators
  - OK
  - Ensure you have Full control checked

 
** SSH troubleshooting

- If there is a connection timeout, this is a SG issue
- Any timeout (not just for SSH) is related to security groups or a firewall
- If there is a connection refused, the instance is reachable but the SSH daemon is not OK
- If there is a `Permission denied`, you are using the wrong user or the wrong key
