# Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp, Udemy - Notes

.ipynb files can be converted to .py using `nbconvert`

Documentation strings in Python are called Docstrings

S-TAB to see docstrings

To find out where your notebooks are write `pwd` in a cell

`$ jupyter notebook` to launch Jupyter in cwd
-> Jupyter is provided by Anaconda

When creating a new notebook w/ Jupyther, choose `Python [conda env:pyxx]`

Anaconda is a distribution of Python

Feel free to use any development environment you prefer

Adding Anaconda to PATH is actually not recommended (might mess up w/ existing python installations)

Anaconda Navigator
Anaconda comes w/ several development environments

JupyterLab (newer) VS Jupyter notebook (older)

Python is not pronounced w/ a `t` (US: thaan, GB: thn)

Jupyter supports both expression evaluation & printing results
- `Out [x]:` is printed out when evaluating an expression

`S-RET`: evaluate cell

Pycharm:
- `C-Up`: move to above cell
- `C-Down`: move to below cell
- `A-S-A`: insert cell above
- `A-S-B`: insert cell below
- `S-RET`: evaluate current cell & insert new cell/move to next cell
- `C-RET`: evaluate current cell
- `C-A-S-RET`: evaluate all cells
- `A-S-RET`: debug notebook
- `C-A`: select cell

Interrupt/Restart the kernel to interrupt cell executions

IPython (_Interactive Python_) was the name of the Jupyter notebooks back when Python was the only editor supported
-> Called now _Jupyter notebooks_ because of R & Julia support

Code cells & Markdown cells (w/ LaTeX support) are supported (literate programming?)
