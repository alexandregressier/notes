* 1. Introduction

** 1.1 Introduction to course

   Serverless technologies
   Paradigm
   AWS Lambda

   Focus on *operational aspects*

   _Operational challenges:_
   - Testing & debugging
   - Monitoring
   - Logging
   - Configuration management
   - Migration
   - CI/CD
   - Security
   - Distributed tracing

   \to Lack of *structured content* on helping you tackle those challenges

   *Tools & practices* for serverless are *lagging far behind* existing microservices architectures

   _Ops:_ umbrella term for everything related to keeping your system *operational & performing* within acceptable parameters

   *Event-driven programming model*

   AWS Lambda offers *scalability & cost efficiency*
