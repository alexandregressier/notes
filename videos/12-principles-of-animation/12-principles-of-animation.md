12 Principles of Animation
(used by Disney Studios animators)
-> Make animations more realistic & emotional

1. Squash & Stretch
- The more squash, the softer the object
- The less squash, the stiffer the object
- Emphase face expressions
- Keep the volume of the object consistent
- When starting to fall, there should be no squash

2. Anticipation
- Crouching down is a sign of jumping
- Arm back is a sign of punching
- Winding up is a sign of running
- Preparing the audience by preparing them for the next action
- The goal is that the audience is not missing why an action is taking place
- No concurrent action
- You can trick the audience by falsing anticipation
- You can have multiple levels of animation

3. Staging (IMPORTANT)
- The presentation of any idea so that it is completely clear (multiple steps)
- Broad area, applies to: acting, timing, camera angle & position
- Be in full control of where the audience is looking at (e.g., a banana peel)
- HAVE ALWAYS A CLEAR IDEA OF WHERE THE AUDIENCE IS LOOKING AT (no competion of action)
- The camera has a lot to do w/ this:
  - Far away: big actions (either in the center or in the thrids)
  - Close-up: expressions
- Have proper timing and do not distract the audience everywhere)
- Make process if you want the viewer to process something
- When seeing a text, you should be able to say it outloud 3 times (IMPORTANT)
- In addition to controling the viewer eyes, it is also about converying ideas (exagerate ideas & have no object that ditract from that purpose)

4. Straight Ahead & Pose to Pose
- Animate drawing
- Pose to Pose VS on the go: you draw intermediate positions after (i.e., give more and more fps)
- Make you spare a lot of time by catching problems early on
- Straight ahead: animating something unpredictible (e.g., Fire, Water, Dust)
-> You do not know how to in between it
- Complete pose to pose w/ straight ahead for the need parts (e.g., a tail)
- Pose to Pose vocabulary: keys, extremes, breakdowns

5. Follow through & Overlapping action
- Add body parts and appendages behind animated bodies (continue to move when the body stops)
- Associated w/ another technique called "Drag" (all describe the same thing but in different ways)
- Follow through: refers to how the body parts moves after the body part stopped
- Overlapping action: describe the offset between the movment of the body and the element
- Drag: delaying the element when compared to the main body
- When the main body moves, the tip of the appendage should be the last to catch up
- A body would also follow through when landing
- Skin can sometimes be considered as an appendage
- Add appendages (e.g., hair) after the main body
- For an arm, the elbow leads the arm action and the hand is an appendage (e.g., when walking)
- Offset the animation of appendages (e.g., bottom half and top half of a body)

6. Slow in & Slow out
- Pretty much all movement should start slow, build speed, and finish slowly (e.g., cars)
- Core principle to achieve life-like motion
- Robots are an exception
- When doing pose to pose 2D animation, you should thus draw more breakdown at the beginning and the end than in between
- When doing 3D animation & motion graphics, adding slow in & slow out is a matter of changing the motion curve from linear to spline, by adjusting the bezier handles
- Be careful:
  - You wouldn't add a slow out on a boucing ball ready to touch the ground
  - You wouldn't add it to the bullet of a gun
- Really quick animation can be achieved in 3D w/ extreme curves
- A good way to fix a choppy naimation is to analyse where the poses are in the timeline (slow in, speed up, slow out)

7. Arcs
- Most living creatures will move in circular paths: arcs
- A boucing ball should move in arcs
- When doing this in 3D & motion graphics, keep the movement in the x axis constant, but give the movement in a y axis a slow in & slow out: this will give the ball its arc
- When a head is moving, it is important to add an arc to make it less dull
- Do not get trapped & by in between poses & draw arcs for every movements
- Body follow through should take place in an arc
- When movement is very fast, you can add arcs in the form of a smear (using the same color as the object w/ transparency/fragmentation)

8. Secondary Action
- Secondary Action is not Overlapping Action
- Gesture that supports the main action to add more dimension to the character animation
- When a character is walking agrily:
  - The primary action is the legs
  - The secondary is everything else (e.g., arms swinging, head buggling)
- When a character is knocking on a door, the secondary action of the other hand will communicate how the character is feeling (e.g., a fist = angry, danty = happy vibe)
- When a character is a picking up a box, you can give him more personnality by making rub his hands together and twiddle them in the air
- Do not let the secondary action become the primary action (e.g., a character crying should have his face visible even when using a tissue) + give a tear its own time (staging)
- Make a character eating lick is lips + move his eyebrows + shake his head...
-> The secondary actions adds more dimension to the primary action

9. Timing
- The personnality & nature of an animation is greatly affected by the number of frames inserted between each main action
- If you have a lot frames between each poses (implying a fixed FPS value), the animation is very slow
- Very few frames = fast
- 1 simple action can have 10 different meanings depending how many frames you give it
- A character moving his head fast looks like he has been hit, whereas if he moves it slowly he may be simply doing a sign w/ his head
- The standard framerate for movies is 24 FPS
- If there is a drawing for every frame, we call it _drawing on ones_
- 2 frames = drawing on twos
- 3 = on threes, etc
- Very common to draw on twos (makes animation smoother & w/ less jittering b/c less precision)
- As a consequence, drawing on ones is used when fast action is taking place
- Some people add frames depending on how much movement there is

10. Exaggeration
- Every action or pose can be taken to the next level to increase the amount of impact on the viewer
- Add more realism =/= drawing a realistic mouse for Mickey =/= Make physics and proportions more consistent w/ reality
- Add more realism = exaggerate it = make the idea or essence of the action more appearant & real
- If a character is sad, make him sadder (has a link to anticipation)
- Caution: exaggeration does not mean more distorted, but more convincing
- Exaggeration can always be added (when something seem fnished, you can exaggerate it further)
- When motions are quick, the exaggerations needs to be bigger in order to be noticed
- Frames can look extreme when taken individually: make them longer or exaggerate it more to make it more extreme
- Rule of thumb: push the exaggeration level until it actually becomes too much, then wind it back until you are satisfied w/ it (that way you see the full range)

11. Solid drawing
- Make forms present in 3 dimensional space w/ volume, weight, & balance
- Drawing a figure from all angles might help (requires a knowledge of 3D)
- Cube edges should be drawn towards the _vanishing point_
- Use basic shapes (e.g., cylinders, spheres) to construct your characters (instead of flat shapes: circle, rectangles...)
- Draw perspective lines on the ground to know when to draw bigger or smaller
- When moving on clean lines, be mindful of overlap between shapes and include it whenever possible (e.g., sleeves)
- W/o overlap, everything appears to be on the same plane: adding line helps to find where shapes come out & recede
- Avoid symmetry when drawing lines: pair a straight line w/ a curve line / or two curve lines
-> So it look smore natural & dynamic (corelates to arcs)
- Applies to 3D animation as well: portrait weight & balance in the pose of a character
- Avoid "twinning": paired features (e.g., legs, arms) are doing the exact same thing (requires a conscious effort to avoid)
- Example: put one hand on the hips
-> Show that there is weight and the character must keep his balance

12. Appeal
- Characters that you animate must be pleasing to look at
- They should have some sort of charismatic aspect to like about them (applies to both heroes & villains + all the other characters)
- Appeal =/= good-looking = interesting to look at
- Everyone has a different standard for what is appealing
- Giving a character a dynamic design boosts his appeal:
  1. Use a variety of shapes (e.g., muscular & fat characters) + Every good character design starts w/ a clear shape (in 2D)
  2. Proportions: cartoonists often magnify the things we find interesting & shrink the things that we find ugly or boring (Mickey is a good example w/ its gloves) + Find aspects of the character that define their personality & exaggerate it
  3. Keep it simple: too much info can complicate the character & more difficult to animate (drawing for illustration is different from draing for animation)
