# Dart in Action, Manning - Notes

<https://dart.dev/get-dart>

Dart SDK default location: `/usr/lib/dart`
Add its `bin/` directory to `PATH`

Project templates:
- *Console Application:* contains `bin/`, `lib/`, and `test`
- *Simple Console Application:* contains only `bin/`

IMPORTANT: by convention, Dart prefers snake case over Lisp case
