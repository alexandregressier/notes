Kotlin's version at the time of writing: 1.3.61

* Preface

Kotlin appeared in 2011
Created by JetBrains

Unlike other JVM languages (e.g., Scala), Kotlin interacts w/ Java at the *source level* whereas they interact at the
*library level*
-> They have to be built as separate projects

Kotlin was adopted by Gradle which allows using the same language for *the build and what is built*

Google adopted Kotlin as an official language for Android b/c the version of Java under it is 6

Java's promises:
- "Write once, run anywhere"
- Backward compatibility (not always repected though) -> Has constantly played against Java's evolution
- Make program safer by using checked exceptions

Problems w/ Java:
- The template types does not support primitives and therefore requires many conversions
- Checked exceptions are often wrapped into unchecked ones

Kotlin supports both mutable and immutable references, but promotes the latter
Kotlin has a great part of the functional abstractions that let you avoid control structures
