Premiere Pro version at the time of watching: CC 2020 - 14.0.1 (Build 71)

* Introduction

** Start a new project and understand the workspace

Any panel can be resized / moved around / closed

Source monitor is where your video source files appear
Effects control allows you to manage effects

Audio Track Mixer VS Audio Clip Mixer

Workspaces seems to be saved on a per-project basis

To import a source file, you can:
- Double click the project panel's blank space
- File > Import...
- <C-i>
- Drag & drop files

You can then select one to multiple files

A folder in the project tree is called a /Bin/:
- Right click > New Bin
- Click the icon
- <C-b>

You can import a whole directory by:
- <C-i> then "Import Folder"
- Drag & drop it

All the music is copyright-free
-> Can be found in the /YouTube Audio library/

/B-roll/: (a.k.a. cutaway footage) is videos, photos, or graphics that is intercut w/ the main shot
E.g., in an interview, you may intercut videos of the person's life to further illustrate the points

Renaming a project resource:
- Press <RET>
- Double click its name
-> You have to keep enough structure to be able to quickly find any resource

Viewing a resource in source monitor:
- Double click its icon

The Bins are completely detached from the underlying directories in the filesystem
- The same applies for resource names
- Find the right balance between clearness & conciseness when choosing a name
- When done renaming, just click elsewhere

Video resources can have heterogeneous framerates

DSLR: digital single-lens reflex camera


** Stabilize your video

Double click any Bin to view it in a dedicated panel

Drag & drop a video resource to the "New Item" button to create a new timeline w/in the project

Effects can be search via the dedicated bar
-> "warp" > Warp Stabilizer
-> Drag & drop the effect on the bar of the video of the timeline (e.g., V1)

The Effect Controls presents all the effects on the current video of the timeline
-> The progression can be seen in the corresponding effect section

Result:
- Smooth motion: moves slowly
- No motion: the shot is completely still

An effect can be toggled by clicking "fx"


** Use Media Browser to import clips

Media Browser is a panel that makes browsing camera files (w/ a lot of junk) easier

You can import any file by:
- Right click > Import
- Drag & drop


** Premiere Pro CC updates

95% of features are version independent


* Editing your video

** Start a new sequence

Take the main clip (i.e., the one that will be used most)

Creating a new sequence from it:
- Drag it on "New Item"
- New Item > Sequence
- File > New > Sequence
- <C-n>

Sequence Presets can be chosen (e.g., Digital SLR)
1080p24 means 1080p resolution at 24 FPS

Or you can create custom settings:
- Settings tab > Editing Mode: Custom
- Audio Sample Rate: 48000 Hz & Display Format: Audio Samples typically what you want to choose
- The sequence can be renamed at the bottom

The new sequence take the settings from the main clip
-> Sequence > Sequence Settings...
-> Matching settings w/ the main clip is typically what you want

The new sequence will appear in the Project panel

In the timeline:
- Videos are at the top & noted Vn
- Audio is at the bottom & notes An

There are 3 tracks for both video & audio by default


Drag a clip above or below the existing tracks to create a new track

Tracks:
- Can be moved vertically: from Tn to Tm
- Can be moved horizontally

The timeline cursor is called the /timeline indicator/

The sliders at the bottom and on the right enables you to:
- Scroll through the sequence OR use the mouse scroll
- Zoom in / out by dragging an end

IMPORTANT: <+> & <-> can be used to zoom in or out as well
- <S-+> expands all the clips


** Adding clips to the timeline, syncing footage, and making selects

Multiple shots of the same actions need to be synced on the timeline

Add other clips to the existing sequence by dragging them on a track
-> You can even take this opportunity to create a new track

The timeline indicator can be used to snap clips

Select clips in the timeline by:
- Box selecting them
- Using <S-Click>

Visibility:
- Click the eye to toggle video clips
- Click the M to toggle audio clips
- Place clips w/ in tracks above others to make them appear above them as well

To see the wave form of audio or thumbnails of videos, click in the right padding of the column where Vn & An are located
-> Or resize them vertically

You are lucky: clip A & B are the same length & begin at the same time

If it was not the case:
- Trying to nudge the clips by making the wave forms of the audio matching
- Use automatic syncing:
  - Box select the two unmatching clips you want to match
  - Right click > Synchronize
  - Select Audio and Track Channel: Mix Down
  -> Automatic syncing does not automatically work & sometimes have to be used multiple times
  -> You can now box select the two clips & place them wherever you want

Playing content in the source monitor:
- <Space> to play the file in the source monitor
- <Left> or <Right> to move frame by frame
- <S-Left> or <S-Right> to move 5 frames by 5 frames

Import specific parts of clips w/ the source monitor:
- Press the Mark In "{" button <I> to mark the beginning of the clip
- Press the Mark Out "}" button <O> to mark the end of the clip
- Adjusting the mark in or out after adding the clip won't affect it

Adding the clip source monitor to the timeline:
- Drag the thumbnail into the timeline
- Use the Drag Video/Audio Only button (in the middle) to drag only video or audio
- Use Insert <,> & Overwrite <.> in combination w/
  - The timeline indicator
  - The V1 & A1 button (on the leftmost part of the timeline column "source patching")
    -> Those button can be dragged instead of toggling them (like radio buttons)
  -> Overwrite erases a part of the original clip
    -> Use an empty track to insert it (i.e., overwriting nothing)
  -> Inserts split the original clip
    -> Using an empty track will still separate the other clips


** Exercise: Synchronize audio & video

IMPORTANT: You need the audio (of low quality) of the video to synchronize via audio
-> Otherwise you can only synchronize via the beginning or ending

Select Track channel: Mix Down once again

Warning: Synchronize did a good job but it is not perfect looking by the offset in the claps (1 frame too slow)

To fix this:
- Hamburger of timeline > Show Audio Time Units
-> You can zoom in more now
-> Note that only audio (including from videos) can be nudged more precisely than a frame

Disable/Enable a clip:
- Select any audio or video clip
- Right click Enable to disable the clip

To select only the audio clip from a video:
- <M-Click>

Link the video and the external audio:
- Select the video & its original (disabled) audio
- Right click > Unlink to unlink the original audio
- Select the video, its freshly unlinked audio, and the external audio
- Right click > Link
-> This keeps the video & its audio altogether when using tools (e.g., the razor)


** Basic edits - Trim clips, split edits, and more!

To clear in & out in the source monitor:
- Right click on graduations > Clear In and Out

Tools is the panel at the left of timeline:

- Selection Tool <V>: select panels, resize, select clips
  - Changes to the Trim Edit Tool when being on one of the vertical edge of a clip
  - You can trim back & forth once you trimmed a first time
  - You can see where you are trimming in the /Program Monitor/
  -> W/ <C->, this is the tool you will use the most

- Razor Tool <C>: cutting clips up
  - You can then clear the parts you cut that do not interest you
  - Work on a single clip at time, but can work on all clips by pressing <S->
  - You can use the timeline indicator to snap on a particular frame as well
    -> Disable snapping by pressing <S> or by clicking on the Magnet icon on the right of the tools
  -> You can select an empty space between two clips on the same track and clear it <Delete> to connect them
    -> Or Right click > Ripple delete

- Ripple Edit Tool <B>: when trimming a clip, ripple delete automatically (on the contrary to the Trim Edit Tool <V>)
  - When pressing <C->, the Trim Edit Tool becomes the Ripple Edit Tool when placed on a edge

- Rolling Edit Tool <N>: useful to find junction points between clips
  -> Makes a shorter to make an another longer
  - When pressing <C->, the Trim Edit Tool becomes the Rolling Edit Tool when placed between edges

- Slip Tool <Y>: the video on the left show where the clip will start & the one the left where it will end

- Slide Tool <U>: drag a clip between two others to adjust their limits


You rarely want to delete the audio of a video
-> Just disable it w/ <M-> & then Right click > Disable
-> The difference w/ the eye or M is that it affects a clip & not the whole track

The goal of the project is to cut down this raw interview of 7 minutes into a 1 minute dynamic clip


** How to edit down an interview

Move up video clips that you like

When the video is playing, use <j>, <k>, <l>, <Left>, & <Right>
-> <k> pauses the playback
-> <l><l> & <k><k> = x2
  -> Interesting to use when the video is long

As a video editor, you have to go through an interview multiple times in order to determine the good parts
-> Mostly based on intuition (therefore it is important to get second opinions on your edit)
-> Video editing is a personal way to make a story

IMPORTANT: you can still use the tools (e.g., the razor) while the video is playing

In an emotional interview, let the person rumbling to let him get deep into his feelings
-> As an interviewer, do not hesitate to ask a question again if the interview is well defined

If you had a single shot for the interview, you could have used the source monitor & drag the part that interests you

You really should consider saving the sequence you made selects w/in

<S-Delete> = Ripple delete

Do not forget to move your selects to the below track once done

Enable auto-save:
- Edit > Preferences > Auto Save
-> 5 minutes sounds appropriate
-> Maximum projects version corresponds to the number of backup made
-> The backups are located to the same place your project is (i.e., "Adobe Premiere Pro Auto-Save")

B-rolls are useful when you find yourself w/ jump cuts throughout your sequence

It make sense sometimes to just cut the audio by pressing <M->

- Track Select Forward Tool <A>: select all the clips to the right of the cursor
  - Press <S-> to select a single track (and audio if it has one)
  -> You can then drag what you selected to the left to overwrite the clips
  - You can then nudge those clips w/ <C-Left> or <C-Right> (Or <C-S-Left> or <C-S-Right>)

A good thing to keep in mind is what b-roll do you have to know when to cut

You can resize any part you trimmed too much

Having a little moments to breath between sentences is always good
-> Especially when you want to add a motion to something


** Adding cutaway footage and photos

Sometimes, you just have to deal w/ the b-roll you are provided w/

It is a good point to have the subject in the first shot to present him to the audience

Expanding video tracks to see their thumbnails is especially useful w/ b-roll

Repressing <I> or <O> resets the previous marks

It is not a problem if your b-roll goes past the next interesting line

When he talks about being viral, use the b-roll that shows how he was viral

You can select multiple images from the project panel & drag them in the timeline

Create a matte background:
- (Optional) Create a Bin to store your graphics
- New Item > Color Matte
- Let the default settings to match your current sequence
- Pick the color
- Drag the matte in the timeline
-> A matte is simply a color

IMPORTANT: you can select multiple edges at the same time

A good idea would also have been to put one of two shots where he is cruising at the beginning and the other one at the end
